# SQL_Customers_DB_advanced_querying
In this project, I've used intermediate to advanced level SQL queries to explore the **Brick & Mortar** and **E-Commerce** customers database of a company. I've used various SQL techniques such as Joins, Sub-queries, CTEs, Text functions and so on to analyze the data.

## Problem Statement
Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.

However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts.
Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both the skills.

## Task
Imagine yourself as the applicant for this role and perform the following task
1. Check ‘ad-hoc-requests.pdf’ - there are 6 ad hoc requests for which the business needs insights.
2. You need to run a SQL query to answer these requests. 
3. The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management - hence you need to create a powerpoint presentation to show the insights.
4. Be creative with your presentation.

## Action
1. Use MySQL database for storing the records
2. Uses Advanced SQL concepts like **Joins, Subquery, CTEs, and Window function** to write complex queries to find out insight from the records.
3. For automation use advance stuff like **Stored Procedures and Views**.
4. Learn domain knowledge: fiscal year, quarters, profit & loss statements.
5. Use Google and Chatgpt as mentor whereever find difficulty.
